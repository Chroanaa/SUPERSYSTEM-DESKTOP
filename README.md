## This project will be soon working..

The primary agenda and possible contents here would be following:
1. Blotter Management System - From filing incident reports or even filing complaints this is where BPSO,LUPON,BADAC and BCPC / VAWC comes in after they had registered account credentials process given by Brgy. Secretary Team 
2. Document Management System - Inside the Records managing this has already been growing but in my plans I will wanted to rewrite the whole as my decision so basically one of features here is the User Tracking to determine initial transactions that he/she had by navigating thru Users History.
3. Scheduling System - Partially, this part would be handle mostly by LUPON Tagapamayapa.
4. Procurement - This part belongs to Brgy. Treasurer in Web Portal.
